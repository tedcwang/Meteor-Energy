AFFECTING FIREBALL RADIATED AND IMPACT ENERGY

Abstract: Fireballs emit large amounts of energy as they travel through the Earth’s atmosphere. By testing whether altitude, velocity, velocity components, or position affects a fireball’s radiated energy, is it possible to determine a meteor’s impact energy with only a few measurements? R’s regression analysis and Bayesian Information Criterion prove that none of the factors impact a fireball’s radiated and impact energy to a significant degree; however, velocity is closely related to velocity components and altitude. Even if no relationships exist as of now, future fireball reports and data may offer a new insight.
Key words: space, atmosphere, fireball, velocity, altitude, radiated, impact, energy
